    <h2> Justin Bieber - Peaches ft. Daniel Caesar, Giveon </h2>
    I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit) <br>
    I get my weed from California (that's that shit) <br>
    I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch) <br>
    I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it) <br>
    And I see you (oh), the way I breathe you in (in) <br>
    It's the texture of your skin <br>
    I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby <br>
    Never let you go, oh <br>
    And I say, oh, there's nothing like your touch <br>
    It's the way you lift me up, yeah <br>
    And I'll be right here with you 'til the end <br>
    I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit) <br>
    I get my weed from California (that's that shit) <br>
    I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch) <br>
    I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it) <br>
